## Requirements Analysis
The school requires reliable workstations for daily student use.
**Key Usage:**
* Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint).
* Web Browsing (Research & Online Exams).
* Coding Environments (VS Code, Python).

**Constraint:** Computers must be durable and fast to boot up between classes.

##  Hardware Recommendations

### 1. Processor (CPU)
* **Selected Component:** Intel Core i3 (12th Gen) 
* **Why:**  Sufficient for office tasks, programming, and web browsing while being energy-efficient and budget-friendly.

### 2. Memory (RAM)
* **Amount:** 8GB 
* **Why:** Ensures smooth multitasking for Web Browsing and Office apps without lag, plus handling basic coding tasks.

### 3. Storage 
* **Type:** SSD NVMe (M.2)
* **Capacity:** 256GB
* **Why:** Balances cost and performance; 256GB is ample for school apps, while NVMe ensures instant boot times.

### 4. Graphics (GPU)
* **Selection:** Intel® UHD Graphics 730 (Integrated with CPU)
* **Why:** Integrated graphics fully support the curriculum (Python, Web, Office) while significantly reducing power consumption and heat output in the lab.

## Peripherals
### 1. Monitor
* **Selection:** 24-inch IPS Display (FHD 1920x1080, 75Hz)
* **Why:** IPS panels offer wide viewing angles for student collaboration, and 1080p is the standard for educational software.

### 2. Input Devices
* **Selection:** Wired Keyboard & Mouse Combo (Business/School Grade)
* **Why:** Wired connections prevent battery issues and reduce theft risk in public labs.
